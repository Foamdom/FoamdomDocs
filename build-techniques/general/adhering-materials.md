## Terms

#### Substrate
- The surface to which an adhesive is to be applied for bonding.
- We'll never use this term because it is very extra, but hey, now you know.

#### Wetting
- The ability of an adhesive to stick to a surface immediately upon contact.
- A more viscous adhesive will have better wetting and will spread more easily, but can also be runny and make more of a mess if used without care.

#### Tack
- The stickiness or ability of an adhesive to affix to an object.
- Adhesive generally has a period where it has very low tack immediately after applying, during which time it is best to leave it exposed to the air.
  - This is usually referred to as waiting for the adhesive "to tack".
- It is best to connect surfaces once their adhesive coatings have achieved enough of a tack that they won't immediately come apart.

#### Set, Setting
- The process of solid adhesion taking place after the application of the adhesive and the two surfaces coming together to form a bond. Once the adhesive sets, it should resist having the bonded surfaces manipulated.
- Manipulating the surfaces after the adhesive has set and before curing has finished can cause weakness in the bond.

#### Open Time
- The time you have once you apply the glue before it sets.
- It is critical to get surfaces bonded before this time has passed.

#### Cure, Curing, Cured
- The chemical process in which a material hardens. It can occur because of cross links forming between polymer chains. Other possible ways a material can harden include exposure to heat or UV light, and with the addition of special chemicals.

#### Offgass, Offgassing
-  the process by which an adhesive releases a gas or vapor. This can happen during the curing process or when the adhesive is exposed to high temperatures.

#### Contact Cement
-  An adhesive which, when coated on two mating surfaces and allowed to dry, provides a permanent bond when brought into firm contact and allowed to set/cure.

#### Epoxy
- Epoxies are created by polymerizing a mixture of two starting compounds, the resin and the hardener (a catalyst paired with the given resin).
- When resin is mixed with the hardener, curing is initiated.

#### Thermoplastic Adhesives
- Also known as hot-melt adhesives (HMA), most commonly found as "hot glue" sticks for use with hot glue guns.
- Thermoplastic adhesives are solid at room temperature but melt when heated.
  - A hot glue gun melts the glue with a heating element.
  - The user squeezes the hot glue out of the gun with a trigger or finger pressure.
  - The glue is sticky when hot and solidifies in seconds to a minute.

#### Synthetic Rubber Adhesives
- The type of adhesive found on Carpet Tape.
  - Requires no set or cure times, can be trusted to instantly provide a strong, shear-resistant, bond between two surfaces.
  - Will generally be able to be removed from a surface and leave very little residue.
- Comes in a variety of forms other than what is on Carpet Tape, many of which act and are used very differently.

## Using Adhesives

Make sure surfaces are clean, dry, and free of foreign material. Remove any previous finishes and roughen painted or non-porous surfaces prior to applying the adhesive. A medium grit (150 or so) sandpaper or a rasp can be used to great effect.

Most adhesives will have issues with curing in cold environments. It is recommended to keep adhesives above 60 F during the 24 hours prior to use, to have the materials being bonded also be above 60 F when the adhesive is applied, and to store the bonded materials at above 60 F while the adhesive cures.

It is a good idea to cover your work surface with something that can protect it from the adhesives. Beyond protecting your work surface, this also makes cleanup much easier. Instead of laying out/taping down paper, it is actually best to use something stiffer, like sheets of cardboard; this is because the stiffness will make it easier to lift away foam that may be slightly stuck to it, as paper would often try to "come with" and often tear, undoing the protection it was providing and making more mess.

With any adhesive, you will want to be working in a well ventilated area. If you are working indoors, a table next to an open window, with a box fan blowing outside set in the window, is ideal. If you are working in a garage with an open door, it is still a good idea to have some sort of fan pulling the fumes away from you as you work. Adhesive will also offgas while curing, so storing them somewhere these fumes will not cause harm is also important; leaving things to cure next to your home's HVAC, a relatively sealed room, near your sleeping area, or in your car is not a good idea and should be avoided.

### Contact Cement (from a can)

Contact adhesives generally have a longer "open time" than the other adhesives we use, meaning that they take longer to tack and set, allowing ample time to reposition the surfaces being bonded, but also creating a larger window where you can mess up any alignment. As such, these are the most time consuming adhesive to use for layered construction.

- Stir and apply adhesive
  - Stir the cement with a paint paddle or stirring stick. Apply an even coat to both surfaces with a paint brush, roller, or trowel. 
  - You are trying to get even coverage, rather than saturating the material/surface with adhesive. Try to avoid putting so much on that there would be a large amount of "squeeze out" when you push surfaces together.
- Let surfaces dry
  - Allow the surfaces to dry for 15â€“20* minutes, or until they feel tacky and look glossy. 
- Align and press surfaces together
  - Align the surfaces and press them together firmly. Apply pressure across the entire surface. 
- Let the adhesive cure
  - Allow the adhesive to fully cure for at least 24* hours.

Contact cements can also be put in carpenter's syringes and injected into voids through gaps/holes in foam, which can be a great way to resolve lamination that has broken down in discrete locations without disassembling or cutting foam, saving work and materials during repairs.

### Spray Adhesive

Spray adhesives generally have a relatively short "open time", and will tack more readily than contact cement that needs brushed onto a surface. Other than being sprayed onto a surface rather than being spread onto it with a sponge, brush, or roller, these work very similarly to contact cement (some of them *are* contact cement, just in a spray form). They generally have a shorter tack, set, and cure time, which is has both advantages and disadvantages, but leans much more heavily into the former for our purposes.
