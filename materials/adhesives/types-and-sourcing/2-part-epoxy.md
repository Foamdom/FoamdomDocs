Only worthwhile for pommels and crosspieces. The epoxy will never come off, though you may need to replace the surface foam...eventually. You will only be able to remove the epoxy with cutting or grinding tools.

Epoxy must first be mixed and then applied to the surfaces to bond, this is done by putting some of the contents of each tube in a small bowl/cup or on a plate or other surface to mix, then applying the mixture to the relevant surfaces. The chemical reaction that makes the epoxy set begins while you are mixing it, leaving you a limited amount of time to apply it and bond things together. Be sure to have everything ready prior to mixing the epoxy and have a plan for application to save yourself headaches.
