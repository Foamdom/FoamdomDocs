# Contact Cement (Spray)

There are a lot of spray adhesives out there. Loctite, Gorilla, and Scotch all have acceptable offerings, and Hi-Strength 90 is technically a higher grade adhesive, but 3M's Super 77 strikes the best balance for cost and effectiveness and is the best overall pick for adhesives that are able to be easily sourced.



| Use Case     | Grade     |
| ------------ | --------- |
| Ease of Use  | Excellent |
| Foam to Core | Great     |
| Foam to Foam | Excellent |
| Tape to Foam | Amazing   |

### Super 77

Very tacky, with a set time that gives you ample opportunity to make sure that pieces are well positioned and in solid contact. Can expect surfaces to stick together well within 10-20 seconds of application and to cure within half an hour. Does not soak into materials as readily as DAP, leading to far less adhesive being needed to coat a surface. 3M markets Super 77 for bonding foil, foam, paper, metal, plastic, fabric, cardboard, and insulation.

### Hi-Strength 90

A stronger adhesive with a slightly wider range of applications than Super 77. This will hands down give a better bond than Super 77 and is recommended for instances where you see Super 77 not being sufficient. There is a difference in usage though: while it is already a best-practice to only use adhesives, especially spray adhesives, in a well ventilated environment, Hi-Strength 90 is one that releases harmful Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) when used and curing; these shouldn't be an issue and it should both stop off-gassing, and thus no longer having the strong smell, after a day or two. Because of these extra concerns, I would not recommend this as a general replacement for Super 77.
