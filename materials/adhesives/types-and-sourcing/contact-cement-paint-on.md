# Contact Cement (Paint On)

There are many contact cements on the market, but you aren't liable to find one that hits the combined price/availability/effectiveness mark that DAP does.

### DAP Weldwood

| Use Case     | Grade |
| ------------ | ----- |
| Ease of Use  | Poor  |
| Foam to Core | Great |
| Foam to Foam | Great |

Strong adhesive, easy to both apply too little and too much, dries and cures slowly, is heavy, messy, easy to spill, can easily go bad if the can is not sealed, and carries a constant risk of getting debris in the can. DAP is often seen as the go-to adhesive for making foam fighting implements, and it is very effective, but there are better, easier to work with, options available.
