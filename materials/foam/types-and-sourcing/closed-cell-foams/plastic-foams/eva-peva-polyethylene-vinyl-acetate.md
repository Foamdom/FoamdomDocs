# EVA/PEVA (Polyethylene-Vinyl Acetate)

While there are different densities of EVA foam, the most useful classification for foamsmithing, at least in regards to creating full-contact foamfighting implements, is between "firm" EVA and "soft" EVA. Both are soft in the grand scheme of things, but one is significantly more pliable than the other and is far less durable because of this.

In general, EVA does not perform as well as XLPE of the same density when it comes to durability. This is a negligible difference for "firm" EVA that behaves more similarly to 4# XLPE, but is much more relevant for softer EVA that behaves more similarly to 2# PE/XLPE and NBR/EPDM, to the extent that I would never actually recommend using "soft" EVA.

## Firm EVA Foam

| Use Case                | Grade     |
| ----------------------- | --------- |
| Pommel                  | Excellent |
| Guard/Crosspiece        | Excellent |
| Box (foam against core) | Excellent |

One of the best foams for making a pommel, the structural foam for a guard/crosspiece, or for the innermost layer of a box-blade build. Foam of this weight should not be used for striking surface. When using foam of this weight as part of the foundation of a stab tip, it should not extend out to the striking surface.

### Puzzle Mat

Generally sold in sets of 4 2'x2' squares with dovetail teeth along 2 or more sides that are 3/8-1/2" thick. This can be found at nearly any large "superstore", hardware store, sporting goods store, pet store...etc. It is by far the easiest item on this page to source locally. Generally also a denser EVA foam, and not as nice to work with as polyethylene sheets.

## Soft EVA Foam

| Use Case  | Grade      |
| --------- | ---------- |
| Stab Tips | Inadequate |

This is what you'd find in Stadium Seats and Yoga Mats. It makes passing stab tips, but compresses out relatively quickly, stretches easily (you'll feel the core sooner), and doesn't do well with shearing forces (which requires more reinforcement to prevent rolling of the tip). Thicker sheets, which will not require as much adhesive and support, can be found online in kneeling mats from various vendors. Because there are nicer options that can be found, I can't recommend using this foam unless you cannot source EPDM nor NBR kneeling pads.
