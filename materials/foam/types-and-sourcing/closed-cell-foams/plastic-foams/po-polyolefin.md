# PO (Polyolefin)

Polyolefin is a type of plastic made from polymers derived from olefins, such as polyethylene and polypropylene, and often includes additives like blowing agents and cross-linking agents when made into a foam. Both PE (Polyethylene) and EVA (Polyethylene-Vinyl Acetate) are considered PO foams. This section will page foams that are not clearly PE nor EVA, but are still PO.

1/2" thick, \~2lb closed-cell polyolefin foam sheets. Commonly used, widely available, easy to cut. One of the major downsides is needing to use a large amount of adhesives to glue multiple layers of foam together where thicker foam options reduce this need. Performs closer to PE foams than EVA foams, and seems more resilient than some other large-cell PE foams of similar weight. It is likely that this is a blend of PE and some sort of rubber, or possibly EVA, similar to Zotefoam's VA-35 offering.
