Generally found as garden and exercise kneeling mats (be sure to make sure they aren't EVA). NBR foam an elastomeric closed cell foam and has properties similar to "soft" EVA foam, but tends to come in thicker sheets (less adhesive and layers to secure and reinforce against rolling), compresses with more spring (less pain for the one being stabbed), resists shearing forces better (lasts longer and requires less reinforcement to prevent rolling), stretches less, and is overall more durable (doesn't compress out and die as quickly). EPDM foam is generally slightly softer than NBR. Technically, EPDM is often a semi-closed cell foam, which lends to how soft it can be. \

Softek (by Fostek) is a semi-closed cell EPDM that is used by Thermaseat to make their kneeling pads and stadium seats.
