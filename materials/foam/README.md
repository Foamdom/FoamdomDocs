# Foam

Foam, rightly so, is the primary material that we use to create implements for foam fighting sports. It is also a space where there can be a large amount of confusion over what is best, which often has foamsmiths reaching for subpar materials because those are the only ones they understand.

Use the pages in the [usage-recommendations.md](usage-recommendations.md "mention")and [types-and-sourcing](types-and-sourcing/ "mention")section to learn more about various types of foams as they relate to foamsmithing.
