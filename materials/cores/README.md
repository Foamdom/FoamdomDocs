# Cores

## Overview

Cores are the foundation of a weapon and are often the longest lasting part, with striking surfaces being replaced multiple times before a good core wears out. The most common items we see used for cores are fiberglass rods and tubes, carbon tubes, and graphite.

## Fiberglass

The most common material found in cores at this time in the sport. 1/2" rods and tubes being the primary choice for weapons under 48" long. A rod is going to be both stronger and heavier than a tube of the same diameter, while it is often ideal to reduce weight as much as possible via using a tube, some weapons may benefit from the extra weight and durability offered by a rod.&#x20;

## Carbon

Carbon can be seen as a straight upgrade from [#fiberglass](./#fiberglass "mention"). It is lighter (a 1/2" carbon rod weighs about 3.25 oz at 60" long) and stronger, both being more durable and resisting flex better. Because they are something that has to be special ordered, and solid carbon rods weighing much more than their hollow fiberglass counterparts, solid carbon rods can largely be ruled out.&#x20;
