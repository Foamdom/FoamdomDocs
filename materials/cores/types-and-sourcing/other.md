### A few things to get out of the way:

No, I will not recommend PVC. You won't like it if you use it.\

Wood generally sucks for weight and is less safe than other options, but people have had good long term experiences with Bamboo and with Hockey Sticks (though the latter would make for a very hard hitting weapon and I recommend against it). Broom handles, dowels, etc, should be avoided.
