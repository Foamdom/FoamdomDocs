# Custom Carbon Fiber Cores

Over the winter of 2024-2025, I vetted a supplier via Alibaba for carbon fiber tubes. The supplier has so far been delivering a very consistent product and in a pretty timely manner after orders are placed. They are also super easy to work with. You can order from them directly or order through me.

NOTE: I can't make any guarantees about the product, but it's been performing well so far and it's hard to argue with the price.

The supplier: [dzhuikai.en.alibaba.com](https://dzhuikai.en.alibaba.com/)

### Need to Know:

* tubes are: roll wrapped, 3k twill finish, polished, not painted
* all measurements need to be in millimeters
* tubes are designated OD\*ID\*Length
  * OD=outer diameter
  * ID=inner diameter
* can be up to 2.5 meters long
* can be connected to make longer tubes\*
  * connection should be closer to pommel than tip

\* _Not yet vetted, but their engineers have given some recommendations and are confident that it would be a strong enough connection._\
\
The specs that I have been ordering and what I _expect_ them to be good for so far:&#x20;

**13mm\*10mm\*1200mm** - _blues and short weapons, javelins, potentially min reds. lighter than kitespar._ \
\
**14mm\*10mm\*2500mm** - _min reds to mid reds (5-6.5ft), possibly long javelins and hoplite spears. slightly heavier than kitespar._\
\
**15mm\*11mm\*2500mm** - _mid reds and 6-7 foot spears_ \
\
**16mm\*12mm\*2500mm** - _mid reds, 8 foot spears_ \
\
**17mm\*13mm\*2500mm** - _long reds (6.5-8 ft), long spears (only tube I am vetting extending via coupler)_&#x20;

If you want to save money ordering them directly from the supplier and don't _need_ longer tubes, you can order them at shorter lengths (<= 1.2 meters) and not have the $45 over-length fee. This can make a big difference. It'd be cheaper to order two 3.9ft tubes than one 8.2ft tube, for example.

Tubes cost about their OD in dollars at 2000mm and $4 more at 2500mm (Ex: 16mm\*12mm, $16 @ 2000mm, $20 @ 2500mm). They may quote you differently, but I don't expect them to. Then you add shipping, which can start as low as $30 (50 for longer tubes), and the over-length fee of $45 if you got anything over 1.2m. An order of two 2 meter tubes will cost $130ish, whereas ten will cost around $260. Conversely, you can get ten 1.2 meter tubes for about $90, because each tube is less than $10.

### Ultralight Tubes

For those of you who don't see 30% lighter than Kitespar (13mm\*10mm) as light enough, I am also going to test tubes with thinner walls. The aim for these was to hit specific core weights at 34". Measurements are OD\*ID, tubes would be 900mm-1200mm long.

2 oz @ 34" \
14\*12 \
13.25\*11 \
12.5\*10

1.5 oz @ 34" \
13.75\*12 \
12.75\*11

We don't _know_ that the tubes will be those weights at those lengths, but math suggests those should be super close. We also don't know how well they will hold up, but it these are less than $10 apiece from the supplier.

### How To Place An Order

#### From the Supplier

Go to the [supplier's page](https://dzhuikai.en.alibaba.com/) on Alibaba, then click "Contacts" in the menu bar. On the page that opens, on the right, click "Send Inquiry"; this will open a new tab. In that new tab, tell them where you are located in the US, and how many tubes of each size you would like to order. You can also ask for sizes other than what I have shared, here, and at whatever length (under 2.5 meters) that you'd like. Request polished, but unpainted, for a matte finish that is more amenable to adhesives.

#### From Me

You can also order from me, which can be less expensive for small orders. I factor in shipping and costs per tube to set my prices. You can reach me via the Discord links in the sidebar. The slight margin is there to offset costs associated with figuring all of this out and being able to stock a few for quicker distribution.&#x20;

Long tubes: \
($ is price for 2500mm/2000mm lengths) \
14mm\*10mm: $36/32 \
15mm\*11mm: $not available/34 \
16mm\*12mm: $40/36 \
17mm\*13mm: $42/38

Short tubes:\
12.8mm\*8mm\*300mm: $4 (coupler insert for 17mm tube) \
13mm\*10mm\*1200mm: $15

I can also ship tubes. I don't have prices for shorter tubes or higher volumes, but I can flat-rate up to 4 long tubes for $30 in the lower 48. For shorter tubes, and for larger orders, it gets cheaper to go directly from the supplier. I am planning to do orders before Sword Knight Boot Camp, Armageddon, and 'Fest this year (2025) and will be at a handful of other 1-day events in the midwest as I am able, so event pickup is also an option.
