| Use Case                         | Grade |
| -------------------------------- | ----- |
| Skinning Flats                   | OK    |
| Skinning Exposed Foam on Shields | Great |
| Securing Shield Covers           | Great |

Duct Tape is almost always better off being replaced by Strapping Tape or a sturdy Fabric Tape, aside from instances where the properties of its backing perform better than other tapes would. Good Duct Tapes in particular are very good for securing covers and doing seam work on shields. I can't say that I'd find it worth it to use it outside of those few instances. Even for skinning flats, a Bi-Directional Strapping Tape is going to be lighter, stronger, and likely stick better, while also providing a better surface for any Strapping Tape that is part of the stab tip's reinforcement to anchor to.

While Duct Tape is a good all-rounder and can serve many purposes outside of what I am recommending it for, at least make sure to adhere to the following: Never put duct tape on any striking surface and try to not put more than 1-2 layers of duct tape along haft padding or on guards, especially if it is thicker and stiffer like Gorilla Tape and T Rex Tape.

### Gorilla Tape

For the price, Gorilla Tape is currently the best on the market for applications where Duct Tape is superior to other tapes. It has a tendency to pull away from the surface in some places if placed down in tension, but will eventually stick and stay if you keep tamping it down as you notice it. The bond provided is quite strong once it sets, and the tape itself tends to have a clean look while also being extremely durable as an outer skin. If you can't source Gorilla Tape, get the closest thing you can find to it. Gorilla also offers an "All-Weather" tape that is more resilient to being out in the elements, like our gear often is.

### Duck Brand Max Strength Duct Tape

Not as thick, nor as durable, as Gorilla's base offering, but is still a reliable tape for the recommended uses. Does not hold fabric in place as well as Gorilla tape, but it being thinner does lend to it being much easier to get good results when skinning irregular surfaces. They also sell an "Extreme Weather" variant that is more resilient and provides a better, more resilient, bond.
