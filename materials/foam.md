# Foam

## Overview

Foam, rightly so, is the primary material that we use to create implements for foam fighting sports. It is also a space where there can be a large amount of confusion over what is best, which often has foamsmiths reaching for subpar materials because those are the only ones they understand.\
\
Below are breakdowns of many commonly used foams, as well as some niche options that can be found if you know where to look that offer significantly better results. Rather than making you sift through all of that if you are just looking for quick recommendations, here is a table of each use case and the foams I would recommend, in order:

## 2lb Closed-Cell Polyethylene Foam

<div align="left">

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Untitled (20).jpg" alt=""><figcaption><p>Standard 2lb Polyethylene Foam</p></figcaption></figure>

</div>

| Use Case                | Grade      |
| ----------------------- | ---------- |
| Striking Surface        | Great      |
| Pommel                  | Acceptable |
| Crosspiece              | Acceptable |
| Box (foam against core) | Acceptable |

Fine, but not great for all around use. Primarily useful for the parts that hit people. Pommels and crosspieces \*can\* be made entirely out of this, but is best for striking surface and to make the impact areas of crosspieces softer; due to the high level of compression, pommels made of 2lb foam will often fail sooner than pommels made with 4lb foam.

### "Blue Foam" (Camp Pads)

<div align="left">

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Untitled (21).jpg" alt=""><figcaption><p>Ozark Camp Pad</p></figcaption></figure>

</div>

1/2" thick, 2lb closed-cell polyethylene foam sheets. Commonly used, widely available, easy to cut. One of the major downsides is needing to use a large amount of adhesives to glue multiple layers of foam together where thicker foam options reduce this need.&#x20;

Note: _The product itself is labeled as being a polyolefin; this just means that it is either polyethylene or polypropylene, and we can be relatively sure that it is not polypropylene, as that is a much stiffer foam, generally used for packaging._

### Cross Linked 2lb Polyethylene

<div align="left">

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Untitled (22).jpg" alt=""><figcaption><p>Cross Linked 2lb Polyethylene</p></figcaption></figure>

</div>

A higher quality, more durable, and all-around-upgrade to "standard" Closed-Cell Polyethelene Sheets and Camp Pads. It has better impact damping than the non-cross-linked forms and holds its shape better while compressing, leading to less twisting. It also resists shearing and tearing better than non-cross-linked polyethelene, making for a much longer lasting striking surface. The only downside is that it is firmer, which means the foam may need broken in depending on the weight of the weapon and the construction of your striking surface.

## 2lb Minicel-L XLPE (Cross Linked Polyethylene)

<div align="left">

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Untitled (23).jpg" alt=""><figcaption><p>Minicel L200</p></figcaption></figure>

</div>

| Use Case         | Grade   |
| ---------------- | ------- |
| Striking Surface | Amazing |

A much more fine-celled foam that is both softer and has higher durability than 'standard' cross linked polyethylene. It would be a waste to use this foam for anything other than striking surface or stab tip foundation.

## 4lb Closed-Cell Cross Linked Polyethylene Foam

<div align="left">

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Untitled (25).jpg" alt=""><figcaption><p>4lb Closed-Cell Cross Linked Polyethylene</p></figcaption></figure>

</div>

| ----------------------- | ------- |
| Pommel                  | Amazing |
| Guard/Crosspiece        | Amazing |
| Box (foam against core) | Amazing |

You aren't going to find a better-rounded and easy-to-source foam to handle being a pommel, the structural foam for a guard/crosspiece, or for the innermost layer of a box-blade build. Foam of this weight should not be used for striking surface. When using foam of this weight as part of the foundation of a stab tip, it should not extend out to the striking surface.

## Firm EVA Foam

<div align="left">

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Untitled (24).jpg" alt=""><figcaption><p>Generic Puzzle Mat</p></figcaption></figure>

</div>

| Use Case                | Grade     |
| ----------------------- | --------- |
| Pommel                  | Excellent |
| Guard/Crosspiece        | Excellent |
| Box (foam against core) | Excellent |

One of the best foams for making a pommel, the structural foam for a guard/crosspiece, or for the innermost layer of a box-blade build. Foam of this weight should not be used for striking surface. When using foam of this weight as part of the foundation of a stab tip, it should not extend out to the striking surface.

### Puzzle Mat

Generally sold in sets of 4 2'x2' squares with dovetail teeth along 2 or more sides that are 3/8-1/2" thick. This can be found at nearly any large "superstore", hardware store, sporting goods store, pet store...etc. It is by far the easiest item on this page to source locally. Generally also a denser EVA foam, and not as nice to work with as polyethylene sheets.

### Volara

<div align="left">

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Untitled (26).jpg" alt=""><figcaption><p>Volara 2A (Polyethylene)</p></figcaption></figure>

</div>

| Use Case                | Grade   |
| ----------------------- | ------- |
| Striking Surface        | Amazing |
| Box (foam against core) | Great   |

A 2lb, closed-cell, cross-linked foam. Can make weapons that tend to feel nicer on hit than 2 lb Minicel. I tend to use it primarily for repairs and as a single outer layer on striking surfaces because it doesn't shear as easily as the porous surface of Minicel thanks to the skin on either side of the thin sheet. It would be somewhat wasteful to use this foam for anything but the striking surfaces of a weapon. Generally sold in thinner sheets, it can be purchased in sheets up to 1/2" thick.&#x20;

## Soft EVA Foam

<div align="left">

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Untitled (27).jpg" alt=""><figcaption><p>Stadium Seat Cushions</p></figcaption></figure>

</div>

| Use Case  | Grade  |
| --------- | ------ |
| Stab Tips | Good\* |

This is what you'd find in Stadium Seats and Yoga Mats. It makes ok stab tips, but compresses out relatively quickly, stretches easily (you'll feel the core sooner), and doesn't do well with shearing forces (which requires more reinforcement to prevent rolling of the tip). Thicker sheets, which will not require as much adhesive and support, can be found online in kneeling mats from various vendors.\
\
\*Because there are nicer options that can be found, I don't recommend using this foam unless you cannot source Polyurethane Foam nor NBR Foam pads.

## NBR (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Rubber) Foam

<div align="left">

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Untitled (28).jpg" alt=""><figcaption><p>Husky NBR Kneeling Mat</p></figcaption></figure>

</div>

| Use Case  | Grade   |
| --------- | ------- |
| Stab Tips | Amazing |

This is what you'd find in garden and exercise kneeling mats (be sure to make sure they aren't EVA). NBR foam an elastomeric closed cell foam and has properties similar to EVA foam, but tends to come in thicker sheets (less adhesive and layers to secure and reinforce against rolling), compresses with more spring (less pain for the one being stabbed), resists shearing forces better (lasts longer and requires less reinforcement to prevent rolling), stretches less, and is overall more durable (doesn't compress out and die as quickly).

### Ensolite

Ensolite is a specific blend of NBR foam that can be bought in commercial sheets.&#x20;

Couch cushions, chair cushions, and the like, are generally made of open cell foams of various densities. Various kinds of open cell foams are used when making arrows for the sport, and it is by far the easiest material to work with when making rocks.

## Tubes & Fries

<div align="left" data-full-width="false">

</div>

| Use Case         | Grade   |
| ---------------- | ------- |
| Striking Surface | Amazing |

By far the easiest way to build a reliable weapon. Fries come in two halves or in one big piece that folds each half together to form a blade, only requiring glue in the center, with all other layers pre-glued or heat-adhered (a stronger, lighter, bond). Tubes come with all layers pre-glued or heat-adhered and will either have a hole down the center (tubes) or a routed channel sized to fit an appropriate core that is also rounded to give optimal surface contact for the glue-up. Depending on the source, tubes may be round or octagonal, whereas fries are generally flat blades, but can also come as what are essentially tubes cut down the middle. \
\
Tubes and fries come in a variety of foams and weights, with some fries even having multiple types of foam in them, generally 4lb boxes under 2lb striking surface foam. This will vary from vendor to vendor and most vendors will not tell you the exact kinds of foam that they use for one thing or another.&#x20;

\*Do not use the built on stab tip on this tube. You will need to remove and properly rebuild it for both safety and to pass Belegarth weapon's check standards.
