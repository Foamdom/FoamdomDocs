# Adhesives

There are a myriad of adhesives that are effective and popular for foamsmithing purposes. DAP and Gorilla Glue are popular go-tos for many foamsmiths, but there are other options that can be just as easy to find, are easier to work with, and work just as well if not better. Below is a brief overview of some of the more prolific options, followed by more in-depth exploration of both those and other options.

Use the pages in the [types-and-sourcing](adhesives/types-and-sourcing/ "mention")section and the [usage-recommendations.md](adhesives/usage-recommendations.md "mention") page to learn more about various types of adhesives as they relate to foamsmithing. See [adhering-materials](../build-techniques/general/adhering-materials/ "mention") in the Build Techniques/General section for advice on general adhesive use.
