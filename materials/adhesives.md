# Adhesives

## Overview

There are a myriad of adhesives that are effective and popular for foamsmithing purposes. DAP and Gorilla Glue are popular go-tos for many foamsmiths, but there are other options that can be just as easy to find, are easier to work with, and work just as well if not better. Below is a brief overview of some of the more prolific options, followed by more in-depth exploration of both those and other options.

## Heat Guns

<div align="left">

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Untitled-1 (4).jpg" alt="" width="169"><figcaption><p>A basic heat gun.</p></figcaption></figure>

</div>

| Use Case     | Grade   |
| ------------ | ------- |
| Ease of Use  | Good    |
| Foam to Foam | Amazing |

Melting foam to foam is the strongest connection you can make and also does not add weight. Heat guns can be found at almost any hardware store or tool supplier.

***

## Contact Cement

There are many contact cements on the market, but you aren't liable to find one that hits the combined price/availability/effectiveness mark that DAP does.

### DAP Weldwood

<div align="left">

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Untitled (32).jpg" alt=""><figcaption><p>A small can of DAP<br>Weldwood Contact Cement.</p></figcaption></figure>

</div>

| Use Case     | Grade |
| ------------ | ----- |
| Ease of Use  | Poor  |
| Foam to Core | Great |
| Foam to Foam | Great |

Strong adhesive, easy to both apply too little and too much, dries and cures slowly, is heavy, messy, easy to spill, can easily go bad if the can is not sealed, and carries a constant risk of getting debris in the can. DAP is often seen as the go-to adhesive for making foam fighting implements, and it is very effective, but there are better, easier to work with, options available.

## Spray Adhesives

<div align="left">

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/shopping (2).webp" alt="" width="150"><figcaption><p>A can of spray adhesive.</p></figcaption></figure>

</div>

| Use Case     | Grade     |
| ------------ | --------- |
| Ease of Use  | Excellent |
| Foam to Core | Great     |
| Foam to Foam | Excellent |
| Tape to Foam | Amazing   |

There are a lot of spray adhesives out there. Loctite, Gorilla, and Scotch all have acceptable offerings, and Hi-Strength 90 is technically a higher grade adhesive, but 3M's Super 77 strikes the best balance for cost and effectiveness and is the best overall pick for adhesives that are able to be easily sourced.&#x20;

### Super 77

<div align="left">

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/shopping (3).webp" alt="" width="150"><figcaption><p>A can of 3M Super 77.</p></figcaption></figure>

</div>

Very tacky, with a set time that gives you ample opportunity to make sure that pieces are well positioned and in solid contact. Can expect surfaces to stick together well within 10-20 seconds of application and to cure within half an hour. Does not soak into materials as readily as DAP, leading to far less adhesive being needed to coat a surface. 3M markets Super 77 for bonding foil, foam, paper, metal, plastic, fabric, cardboard, and insulation.&#x20;

### Hi-Strength 90

<div align="left">

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/shopping (4).webp" alt="" width="150"><figcaption><p>A can of 3M Hi-Strength 90.</p></figcaption></figure>

</div>

A stronger adhesive with a slightly wider range of applications than Super 77. This will hands down give a better bond than Super 77 and is recommended for instances where you see Super 77 not being sufficient. There is a difference in usage though: while it is already a best-practice to only use adhesives, especially spray adhesives, in a well ventilated environment, Hi-Strength 90 is one that releases harmful Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) when used and curing; these shouldn't be an issue and it should both stop off-gassing, and thus no longer having the strong smell, after a day or two. Because of these extra concerns, I would not recommend this as a general replacement for Super 77.&#x20;

## Hot Glue

<div align="left">

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Untitled (33).jpg" alt="" width="169"><figcaption><p>A generic hot glue gun<br>with glue sticks.</p></figcaption></figure>

</div>

| Use Case     | Grade     |
| ------------ | --------- |
| Ease of Use  | Great     |
| Foam to Core | Excellent |

Only worthwhile for pommels and crosspieces. Effective for creating a strong connection to the core that could be removed or reworked later. The hot glue melts the foam and creates a stronger connection. Make sure you are getting glue sticks that are for the temperature range of your glue gun and that are of the appropriate diameter.&#x20;

## Gorilla Construction Adhesives

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/91zHZI31ShL._AC_UF350,350_QL80_ (2).jpg" alt="" width="175"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

</div>

| Use Case     | Grade   |
| ------------ | ------- |
| Ease of Use  | Good    |
| Foam to Core | Amazing |

Only worthwhile for attaching blades, crosspieces, and pommels to the core. Great for absorbing impacts and resisting shearing forces. The "Heavy Duty" is plenty strong, but the "Max Strength" is there if you really feel like you need it.

## Generic 2-Ton Epoxies

<div align="left">

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Untitled-1 (10).jpg" alt="" width="169"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

</div>

| Use Case     | Grade        |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| Ease of Use  | Good         |
| Foam to Core | Unparalleled |

Only worthwhile for pommels and crosspieces. The epoxy will never come off, though you may need to replace the surface foam...eventually. You will only be able to remove the epoxy with cutting or grinding tools.&#x20;

Epoxy must first be mixed and then applied to the surfaces to bond, this is done by putting some of the contents of each tube in a small bowl/cup or on a plate or other surface to mix, then applying the mixture to the relevant surfaces. The chemical reaction that makes the epoxy set begins while you are mixing it, leaving you a limited amount of time to apply it and bond things together. Be sure to have everything ready prior to mixing the epoxy and have a plan for application to save yourself headaches.&#x20;
