## Sport Grip Tapes

Bats, Racquets, Bike Handles, and more all have product lines from a myriad of manufacturers for making grip tapes. Often these are either a pliable rubber, sometimes latex, or are a thin strip of EPDM, NBR, or EVA foam with an adhesive backing, and sometimes a surface coating of some additional protective material or coloration.
