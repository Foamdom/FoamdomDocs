## Steel Bolts & Washers

#### Bolts

Hands down the most cost effective and easy to work with option. If you live in the US, imperial bolts are going to be much less expensive than metric bolts. \
\
The head of the bolt does change how you should build your pommel, as it can affect its longevity. A hex bolt has somewhat sharp edges and corners that will tear at the foam if there isn't an additional barrier, while a carriage bolt's smooth top will not have that issue. At the same time, a carriage bolt has the square indexing under the head, and the corners on this can propagate splits in the core if allowed to apply outward pressure on the interior surface. See [pommels.md](../../build-techniques/hilt/pommels.md "mention")for demonstrations on working around these issues.\
\
Depending on the inner diameter of your core, you will want a different size bolt. It is important to get close to the desired diameter, but it can be better to have a little clearance around the bolt and fill that space with tape for a friction fit, or hot glue, to secure it in place and prevent rattle. See [pommels.md](../../build-techniques/hilt/pommels.md "mention")for examples and advice on how best to handle this.

Below is a table of core inner diameters paired with the most cost effective bolt diameter for weighting them with as little clearance as possible.

Below is a table of bolt diameter, length, and approximate weight. Different grades of steel and types of bolt will weigh differently. You will also add variance when you fill the gap between the bolt and the inner surface of the core. If you want precision, weigh as you work, don't rely on tables like this one.

| Bolt Diameter | Weight at 2" | Weight at 4" | Weight at 6" |
| ------------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| 5/16"         | 0.6 oz       | 1.2 oz       | 1.8 oz       |
| 3/8"          | 1 oz         | 2 oz         | 3 oz         |
| 1/2"          | 1.7 oz       | 3.1 oz       | 4.5 oz       |

The longer the bolt is, the further up the length of the weapon the weight is being distributed and the further forward the balance point will be. While a bolt allows you to put the weight inside the core and thus not increase the volume of the pommel, it can be more effective to use a short bolt and add washers to compensate if you are needing more aggressive back-weighting.&#x20;

#### Washers

Washers themselves provide likely the densest and most versatile option for weighting pommels. If the washer will fit around the core, you can place them around the core. If you use a bolt, the washer only needs to be able to fit around the bolt and the bolt can just stick out of the core a bit further, sandwiching washers against the bottom edge. The same rules apply to filling the space between the inner wall of the washer and whatever it is around as would for a bolt inside the core; the most efficient option that is effective is securing them with hot glue. Washers of various sizes can be used to help secure washers with openings that are larger than the heads of the bolts you are using, and to fine-tune the amount of weight being added. See [pommels.md](../../build-techniques/hilt/pommels.md "mention") for more information about using washers for back-weighting.\
