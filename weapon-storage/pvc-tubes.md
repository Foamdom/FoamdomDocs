# 3"+ PVC Pipe

Large diameter PVC is a perfect storage and transport solution for polearms that don't have crossguards or other protrusions. A 3" PVC Pipe that has a solid cap on one end and a threaded cap on the other with a plug that can be threaded into it will protect the entire length of the weapon from rain, snow, sun, and physical damage. It won't protect it from heat, nor cold, and the weapon will mold if left in something like this across entire seasons, but this would largely enable you to have your polearms essentially have permanent homes attached to a roof rack on a vehicle, or at least make transporting them on top of a vehicle less worrisome.

Larger PVC tubes can be used when necessary, but the 3" variant is perfect for most modern javelins, spears, and glaives, as well as being more than enough for weapons under 4ft in length, as they are rarely wider than 2.75". It can easily be bought in a Schedule 30 variant for around $20 at 10 ft long, with 3" drain pipes around $13 and Schedule 40 around $27. Strength corresponds with price, in that instance. Schedule 80 is not recommended both because of the increased price, not needing the extra strength, and because it is usually a darker material, which will mean your gear is getting even hotter when it's out in the sun.

For transporting multiple weapons at once, it can be more economical to use 8" PVC Sewer/Drain pipe, which should be able to fit 4 of anything that fits in the 3" pipe, with some room to breathe. 10' sections of 8' PVC can be had for around $70, which is already a moderate savings over the cost of getting 3" pipes for 4 polearms, increasing further once you consider the caps for the ends.
